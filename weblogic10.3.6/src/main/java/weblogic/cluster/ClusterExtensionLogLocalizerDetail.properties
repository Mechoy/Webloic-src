messagedetail003101=Updated non-dynamic {0} property on Admin server. Change will be made to config.xml but new value will not take effect till the server is rebooted.
cause003101=Updated non-dynamic {0} property while server was in running state.
action003101=Reboot Admin server for {0} property to take effect.
messagedetail003102=There was a failure in the execution of the post script {0} while deactivating MigratableTarget {1}. Since post script failure is marked as fatal, so the MigratableTarget will not be automatically migrated. To enable automigration, please fix the post script failure and manually migrate the failed migratable target or disable post script failure fatal flag.
cause003102=Execution of post deactivation script failed.
action003102=Fix the post deactivation script and migrate the MigratableTarget manually.
messagedetail003103={0} failed to release its lease because of {1}. This may affect its automatic migration behaviour.
cause003103=An exception occurred: {1}.
action003103=Make sure that if a DB is being used for leasing, that it is available.
messagedetail003104=Failed to notify the execution failure of the post script {1} for {0} to the SingletonServiceStateManager because of {2}.This may affect its automatic migration behaviour.
cause003104=An exception occurred: {2}.
action003104=Make sure that the network is working fine.
messagedetail003105=The async replication request timed out attempting to add object {0} to the replication queue. Once full, the queue waits until it has space for the object. This wait took longer than the ClusterMBean specified AsyncSessionQueueTimeout, thus the session object was not put onto the queue and will not be replicated at this time.
cause003105=The async replication request timed out attempting to add object {0} to the replication queue. Once full, the queue waits until it has space for the object. This wait took longer than the ClusterMBean specified AsyncSessionQueueTimeout, thus the session object was not put onto the queue and will not be replicated at this time.
action003105=This could be due to your secondary server or persistent store slowing down the replication process. In order to better handle this the SessionFlushInterval and the SessionFlushThreshold can be reduced to replicate less at a time, and replicate more often. Also, checking the performance of your secondary server or persitent store is advised.
messagedetail003106=An unexpected exception occured during replication: {0}. Future session updates should replicate as expected.
cause003106=An unexpected runtime exception occured during replication probably from the rmi stub. Future session updates should replicate as expected.
action003106=Make sure that no problems exist in the network. If the problem persists, contact Oracle Customer Support with the stack trace for further analysis.
messagedetail003107=Server failed to receive {0} messages.
cause003107=This is an informational message. When a server joins a stable cluster, you will see this message since it did not receive unicast messages sent out by servers in the cluster.
action003107=No action required.
messagedetail003108=An error occurred while trying to receive a message over the cluster broadcast.
cause003108=An error occurred while trying to receive a message over the cluster broadcast.
action003108=Make sure that the NIC is functioning properly. If you believe there no environment problems exist, contact Oracle Customer Support and provide the stack trace for further analysis.
messagedetail003109=Cluster {0} uses database as the migration basis but no data source for migration has been configured.
cause003109=Cluster {0} uses database as the migration basis but no data source for migration has been configured.
action003109=Make sure that the data source is created and set for database migration basis.
messagedetail003111=No channel exists for replication calls for cluster {0}
cause003111=No channel exists for replication calls for cluster {0}
action003111=Configure the channels for Replication calls.
messagedetail003112=Multiple replication channels are configured which will be used to send secondary update / remove calls.
cause003112=None.
action003112=None.
messagedetail003113=The server is configured to use one way RMI calls for update / remove calls made to secondary server. These calls will return immediately without waiting for any response.
cause003113=None.
action003113=None.
messagedetail003114=One way RMI for replication only works with multiple replication channels.
cause003114=None.
action003114=None.
messagedetail003115=The server is configured to use one way RMI calls for update calls. Due to an error condition some updates could not be applied and hence we have stale sessions on secondary.
cause003115=Work manager queue could be full and hence update messages were dropped.
action003115=Either increase the no of servers in the cluster (preferred) or add more replication channels (requires server re-start).
messagedetail003116=This server will send periodic hearbeats to the other migratable servers in the cluster.
cause003116=None.
action003116=None.
messagedetail003117=This server will monitor death detection hearbeats from Cluster Master.
cause003117=None.
action003117=None.
messagedetail003118=Each WLS managed server in the cluster must be associated with a machine in order to use Member Death Detector.
cause003118=No associated machine configured with the server.
action003118=Please associate a machine with this server.
