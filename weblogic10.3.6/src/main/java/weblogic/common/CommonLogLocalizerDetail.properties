messagedetail000609=The indicated error has occurred while the server was being shutdown.
cause000609=This is an internal error.
action000609=Contact Oracle technical support.
messagedetail000610=This is an internal diagnostic or debug message.
cause000610=Some internal condition has caused this message to be displayed.
action000610=No action required.
messagedetail000611=No resources in the pool will be tested, as specified MaxUnavailable has been reached.
cause000611=The application MaxUnavailable attribute for this pool has been configured. Since the number of unavailable resources in the pool has reached or exceeded the configured limit, no more resources will be tested (as resources become unavailable to the application during the testing).
action000611=Tune the MaxUnavailable attribute for the pool if so desired.
messagedetail000612=All the resource instances currently available in the indicated pool are being tested.
cause000612=This is a warning indicating that all currently available resources in the pool are being tested, hence some or all of them may become unavailable to the application for a short time.
action000612=Reduce the current setting of the MaxUnavailable attribute for the pool.
messagedetail000613=The feature that allows the testing of resources at creation time has been dynamically enabled.
cause000613=This is an informational message.
action000613=No action required.
messagedetail000614=The feature that allows the testing of resources at creation time has been dynamically disabled.
cause000614=This is an informational message.
action000614=No action required.
messagedetail000615=The feature that allows the testing of resources when they are being reserved has been dynamically disabled.
cause000615=This is an informational message.
action000615=No action required.

action000618=No action required.
messagedetail000619=Pool maintenance thread was unable to release the indicated resource back into the indicated pool.
cause000619=As part of the InactiveResourceTimeout feature, resources that are found to be inactive for the configured period of time are forcibly released back into the pool. The operation could not be performed for the indicated reason.
action000619=Contact Oracle Technical Support.
messagedetail000620=The indicated resource is being forcibly released back into the indicated pool.
cause000620=The resource was found to be unused by the application for the specified duration, and hence is being forcibly released back into pool.
action000620=Check application code for leakages of resource objects, or tune the configured value of the relevant pool attribute.
messagedetail000621=The server received a low-level message that contained an unexpected error type.
cause000621=An unexpected low-level message was sent to the server.
action000621=This is likely to be due to an internal server/client error that should be reported to Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail000622=Ignoring an attempt to release a resource back into a pool after the pool has been shutdown.
cause000622=Application is trying to release a resource to a pool after the pool has been shutdown.
action000622=Check application behavior. All resources should be closed before the application is shutdown.
messagedetail000623=CapacityIncrement value for pool has been internally adjusted, since the specified value is invalid.
cause000623=The application had specified an invalid value for CapacityIncrement.
action000623=Check and correct the specified value for CapacityIncrement for the indicated pool.
messagedetail000624=The frequency of testing of free resources for pool has been internally adjusted, since the specified value is invalid.
cause000624=The application had specified an invalid value for the test frequency.
action000624=Check and correct the specified value for TestFrequencySeconds for the indicated pool.
messagedetail000625=The application has disabled the feature to periodically test free resources in pools.
cause000625=Informational message.
action000625=No action required.
messagedetail000626=Free resources in the indicated pool will be tested at the indicated frequency.
cause000626=Informational message.
action000626=No action required.
messagedetail000627=Hit configured maximum capacity of pool while making additional resources for the pool. Therefore, the number of resources being made has been increased.
cause000627=Informational message.
action000627=No action required.
messagedetail000628=The indicated number of resources have been created for the pool.
cause000628=Informational message.
action000628=No action required.
messagedetail000629=Pool was able to recreate only the indicated number of resources rather than the indicated number required.
cause000629=As part of forcibly suspending a pool, all resources currently in use are destroyed and recreated. This message indicates that not all required resources were recreated.
action000629=Contact Oracle Technical Support.
messagedetail000630=Pool was unable to create the indicated number of resources.
cause000630=As part of the ConnectionCreationRetry feature, pools periodically attempt to create unavailable resources. This message indicates that in the current attempt, the indicated number of resources could not be created.
action000630=Check if the failure condition that prevents the resources from being created (for example, database server or downed network connectivity to it) is still persisting.
messagedetail000631=Application is attempting to release a resource that is not known to the pool.
cause000631=Application is trying to release a resource to a pool that is no longer part of the pool. This could happen if the pool was forcibly suspended (which results in all borrowed resources being closed and replaced with new ones) while the resource was borrowed by the application.
action000631=Check application behavior.
messagedetail000632=Pool is shutting down, ignoring resources borrowed from it that are still in use.
cause000632=Administrator is shutting down the pool while applications are still using resources they have obtained from the pool. It is possible that these resources may have been leaked by the applications.
action000632=Check application behavior.
