messagedetail190004=Unable to locate the ConnectionFactory for a resource adapter with the name {0} in the JNDI tree.
cause190004=This warning can occur upon viewing the JNDI tree for the managed server on the console. The other likely cause for this error is that the user has specified an incorrect JNDI name for the desired resource adapter or that the resource adapter is not deployed.
action190004=Ignore the warning if it occurs while viewing the JNDI tree of a managed server. Otherwise, check the deployed connectors in the console and verify the name used to access it.
messagedetail190005=The resource adapter threw a ResourceException when WebLogic Server tried to create a connection factory.
cause190005=The cause is unknown. Consult the resource adapter vendor documentation.
action190005=Examine the exception in the log for more information about how to correct the problem. You may need to refer to the resource adapter vendor documentation to determine an appropriate course of action.
messagedetail190008=A ResourceException was thrown by the resource adapter when attempting to destroy() or cleanup() the ManagedConnection.
cause190008=This error occurs as the result of an attempt to call cleanup() or destroy() on a resource adapter managed connection. The resource adapter can throw a ResourceException if the operation fails. It can also throw an IllegalStateException if, for example, an attempt was made to cleanup a connection when a transaction was in progress. A ResourceAdapterInternalException may be thrown if an internal error condition is detected in the resource adapter.
action190008=Examine the log for the exact type of exception thrown. In the case of an IllegalStateException, you should report the error to Oracle Customer Support. In the case of a ResourceAdapterInternalException, report the error the resource adapter vendor.
