MISSING_JNDI_NAME=This is an inbound resource adapter which defines one or more inbound message listeners and a resource adapter bean in its ra.xml. However, since the weblogic-ra.xml does not specify a JNDI name for the resource adapter bean, it will not be possible for message endpoints (MDBs) to be connected to this resource adapter.

DUPLICATE_RA_PROPERTY=The ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" of type "{2}" and value "{3}" which duplicates a property of the same name and type. The value may not be set as expected.
DUPLICATE_RA_PROPERTY_MULTI_TYPES=The ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" of type "{2}" and value "{3}" which duplicates a property of the same name but with type "{4}". You will not be able to override this default value in weblogic-ra.xml
MISSING_RA_PROPERTY=The weblogic-ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" with value "{2}" which cannot be found in ra.xml and therefor will not be set
