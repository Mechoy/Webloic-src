severity015019=64
messagebody015019=If a session bean instance is participating in a transaction, it is an error for a client to invoke a method on the session object such that the transaction attribute specified in the bean''s metadata annotations and/or the deployment descriptor would cause the container to execute the method in a different transaction context or in an unspecified transaction context. You may also consider setting the <allow-concurrent-calls> option in your weblogic-ejb-jar.xml. When this tag is set, the concurrent call waits for the first method call to complete.
messagebody015020=Cannot specify @JNDIName on both the remote interface and the implementation class. Class: {0}; interface: {1}.
messagebody015021=Cannot specify @JNDIName on the implementation for a class with multiple remote interfaces. Class: {0}; interfaces: {1}.

messagebody015029=The EJB {0} contains an illegal value for the activation config property ''TopicMessagesDistributionMode''. The specified value is {1} but the legal values are: Compatibility | One-Copy-Per-Server | One-Copy-Per-Application
messagebody015030=The EJB ''{0}'' has an illegal permutation on distributed topic type and topicMessagesDistributionMode. Replicated distributed topic works with ''Compatibility'', ''One-Copy-Per-Server'' or ''One-Copy-Per-Application''; but partitioned distributed topic only works with ''One-Copy-Per-Server'' or ''One-Copy-Per-Application''. The EJB is configured to ''partitioned distributed topic'' and ''Compatibility''.
severity015031=16
messagebody015031=The EJB {0} has a ''distributedDestinationConnection'' configured but the EJB is configured to connect to a remote cluster. Since the ''distributedDestinationConnection'' configuration is only valid in a local cluster, the setting will be ignored.
messagebody015032=The EJB {0} is configured with the activation config property ''topicMessagesDistributionMode'' but the EJB is configured to connect to a JMS Queue. The ''topicMessagesDistributionMode'' is only valid for JMS Topic destinations.
messagebody015033=The EJB {0} has an invalid value configured for the activation config property ''{1}''.Only WebLogic JMS server 10.3.4 or later versions support the values ''One-Copy-Per-Server'' or ''One-Copy-Per-Application''. For prior to 10.3.4.0 Weblogic JMS server or other non Weblgoic JMS vendors only the ''Compatibility'' value is supported.

severity015035=16
messagebody015035=The EJB {0} is configured to support One-Copy-Per-Server mode but the partitioned topic is configured as LocalOnly. To support One-Copy-Per-Server mode, the LocalOnly setting will be overridden with EveryMember.

messagebody015036=In the EJB {0}, the value for the activation config property ''{1}'' will be ignored since it is overridden with the value ''{2}'';
severity015037=16
messagebody015037=In EJB {0}, the throws clause for method {1} in the bean class contains exceptions that are NOT in the throws clause of the corresponding {2} interface method.
