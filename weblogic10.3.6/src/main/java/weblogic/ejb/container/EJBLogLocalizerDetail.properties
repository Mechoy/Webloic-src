messagedetail010061=The Message-Driven EJB is unable to connect to the JMS destination. The EJB container will automatically attempt to re-establish the connection with the JMS server. This warning may occur during WebLogic Cluster start-up if the JMS destination is located on another server. When the JMS server connection is re-established, the Message-Driven EJB will again receive JMS messages.
cause010061=The JMS destination is not available due to a network problem or a problem with the JMS provider, or the configuration information in the MDB deployment descriptor and/or annotation is incorrect. This warning may also occur during WebLogic Cluster start-up if the JMS destination is located on another server.

messagedetail010065=The onMessage method for a message-driven bean threw an exception. The server will continue to present messages to this MDB for processing.
cause010065=The onMessage method of the message-driven bean may have thrown an exception for a legitimate reason, such as the loss of a database connection. If that is not the case, then the message-driven bean may have a programming error that causes it to throw an unchecked Java exception, such as a NullPointerException.

messagedetail010079=When attempting to receive a message for a message-driven bean, an error occurred. This error usually occurs after WebLogic Server has successfully connected to the JMS provider, but it is no longer able to receive any messages.
cause010079=The JMS provider for the MDB may have been shut down or crashed, or network connectivity may have been lost.
action010079=Check that the JMS provider is available and accessible through the network.
messagedetail010080=WebLogic Server encountered an error after receiving a message for processing by a message-driven bean and executing the onMessage method for the bean.
cause010080=This error usually occurs if the onMessage method of the message-driven bean throws an exception.
action010080=Check that the message-driven bean is able to process messages by ensuring that any resources it uses (such as database connections) are available. Check the message-driven bean source code to ensure that it does not have any bugs that cause an exception (such as a NullPointerException) to be thrown.
messagedetail010081=WebLogic Server can only use one thread to process all messages for a topic when a message-driven bean requires container-managed transactions and uses a foreign (in other words, non-WebLogic) JMS provider.
cause010081=The nature of the JMS API does not permit this in a standard way.
action010081=No action is required. However, if you require better performance for a foreign JMS provider and do not need exactly-once transactional semantics, re-deploy the MDB so that it has a transaction mode of NotSupported.

cause014003=Optimistic concurrency is implemented by reading data in a local transaction to avoid holding database locks, unless Oracle is used as the database. Oracle read consistency doesn't hold read locks, so in this case reads are performed using the current JTA transaction. When reads are performed in a local transaction updates that have been flushed prior to commit of the transaction are not visible.
