messagedetail149202=The targeted server was unable to commit the task specified. This is an internal error that should not ever occur and reflects a serious problem with the configuration of the server.
cause149202=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149202=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149205=The targeted server was unable to initialize the application because the application container encountered an error.
cause149205=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149205=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149209=The Slave Deployer is resuming.
cause149209=This is an information level message.
action149209=No action required.
messagedetail149229=Clustered servers must successfully deploy all configured applications in order to complete the startup process.
cause149229=This problem occurred due to failed deployments, which are already logged.
action149229=Correct the deployment problem and restart the server in the cluster.
messagedetail149231=There was an internal error and, as a result, the activation state was not properly updated.
cause149231=This is an unexpected error.
action149231=Report this error to Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail149233=An unexpected error was encountered during the deployment process.
cause149233=This represents a problem with the internal implementation that was not anticipated.
action149233=Report the error and any and useful information needed to reproduce the problem to Oracle.
messagedetail149239=The admin server is part of a cluster. Normally, deployment failures during startup of cluster members result in an aborted startup. Since this is the admin server, it is allowed to continue. It must be noted that the cluster is now in an inconsistent state, which could result in failed service requests.
cause149239=One or more applications could not be deployed during the startup of the admin server.
action149239=It is not recommended to make the admin server part of a cluster. One response to this warning is to remove it from the cluster and restart the admin server. Alternatively, review the admin server log to understand why the deployment failed, fix the problem, and redeploy the application.
messagedetail149243=A problem occurred while deploying the internal application ''{0}''.
cause149243=It is likely that the internal staged directory was corrupt or there was a failure when deploying the staged application.
action149243=No action is necessary if the retry succeeds. Otherwise, the nature of the failure should provide an indication of the problem and its resolution. If this is not clear, contact Oracle Customer Support with the relevant logs and configuration files.
messagedetail149245=The document in question is not a deployment plan.
cause149245=The application is configured with an incorrect deployment plan document.
action149245=Deploy the application using a valid deployment plan.
messagedetail149246=The security realm ''{0}'' configured does not support application versioning, and thus the deployment of the application version failed.
cause149246=The security realm ''{0}'' configured does not support application versioning, and thus the deployment of the application version failed.
action149246=Deploy the application using a security realm that supports application versioning.
messagedetail149247=The targeted server was unable to transition the application to running mode because the application container encountered an error.
cause149247=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149247=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149248=The targeted server was unable to transition the application to admin mode because the application container encountered an error.
cause149248=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149248=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149250=There was an internal error and, as a result, the application was not properly unprepared.
cause149250=This is an unexpected error.
action149250=Report this error to Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail149251=This is informational, because the container will be moved to the intended state, regardless.
cause149251=Please see the exception in the message body.
action149251=Typically, no action is required.
messagedetail149252=The operation will have no effect.
cause149252=Please see message body.
action149252=No action is required.
messagedetail149256=The targeted server was unable to find deployment for the application ''{0}''.
cause149256=The cause of this error is likely that deployment is not properly created. One possible reason for this would be it may not have proper descriptors.
action149256=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level and reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149257=Applications must not be stopped prior to redistributing.
cause149257=The application is not stopped.
action149257=Stop the application or use redeploy.
messagedetail149258=Server failed remove the staged files ''{1}'' for application ''{0}'' completely. Check the directory and make sure no other application using this directory. This will result in inappropriate results when this server gets partitioned and trying to deploy this application.
cause149258=Some other application might be using the files under staging directory.
action149258=Delete the above mentioned staged files manually.
messagedetail149259=Clustered servers must successfully deploy all configured applications in order to complete the startup process. Startup failure of any configured deployments will cause the server to be brought up in administration state instead.
cause149259=This problem occurred due to failed deployments, which are already logged.
action149259=Correct the cause of the deployment error(s), redeploy the failed deployment(s), and resume or restart the server in the cluster.
messagedetail149260=A failure occurred during application startup.
cause149260=Please check the error stack trace for details of the failure.
action149260=Correct the cause of the application failure, if possible, and redeploy the application or restart the server. If it is a Oracle internal application, report it to Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail149264=Invalid redeploy attempt on application ''{0}''. There was an attempt to redeploy the application when the application is not running.
cause149264=Application is stopped.
action149264=Start the application.
messagedetail149265=Unable to finish the task due to an error.
cause149265=Look at the underlying error.
action149265=Start the application.
messagedetail149266=Illegal state for operation deploy: ''{0}''.
cause149266=Deploy operation was called on application that was not new.
action149266=Please verify the specified application name and operation are correct.
messagedetail149267=Cancel operation on deployment task ''{0}'' on server ''{1}'' failed.
cause149267=See the underlying exception.
action149267=Take action based on the underlying exception.
messagedetail149268=Application ''{0}'' is non-versioned and its manifest defines version. Modifying manifest with a version for non-versioned application is not supported under static deployment.
cause149268=Manifest modified with version for non-versioned application.
action149268=Remove application and deploy it again with version.
messagedetail149269=Only one type of redeployment is allowed.
cause149269=Server cannot determine which type of redeployment should be processed.
action149269=Correct deployment option.
