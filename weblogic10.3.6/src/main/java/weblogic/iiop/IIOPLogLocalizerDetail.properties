messagedetail002001=
cause002001=This should not occur. This indicates that the client is sending garbaged messages. It might also indicate that malicious third parties are trying to access the server using IIOP.
action002001=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002002=The server was unable to find a suitable method implementation for the name in the request.
cause002002=This can happen for a variety of reasons. Normally, it is because the caller made a request for a non-existent method. Alternatively, the IDL mangling of the method name may be ambiguous, so WebLogic Server cannot decide which method to call.
action002002=If the IDL mangling is causing a problem, try changing the name of the method. In particular, names such as getSomedata() (where somedata is also the name of an attribute or method) can cause problems. Also, some bugs with name mangling in exist in JDK 1.3.1. Try using a JDK 1.4 client.
messagedetail002003=An IOException occurred while preventing transmission of the IIOP message.
cause002003=Some sort of communication failure has occurred. This could be because the target closed the IIOP connection or because of some transient network fault.
action002003=Verify the client-server network connection is working.
messagedetail002005=The server has run out of memory.
cause002005=This is often caused by marshalling mismatches between client and server and is generally a bug in either client or server or both.
action002005=Restart the server and contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002006=The server was unable to create the connection scavenger.
cause002006=The server was unable to schedule a trigger to watch for idle IIOP connections. The fact that it was unable to do so indicates some core failure in the server.
action002006=Restart the server. If this occurs again, contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002024=A low-level communication exception occurred while sending a message.
cause002024=Internal debug.
action002024=None.
messagedetail002025=A low-level communication exception occurred while processing an incoming message.
cause002025=Internal debug.
action002025=None.
messagedetail002008=The server tried to export a remote object before marshalling it and was unable to do so.
cause002008=This is most often caused by the server being unable to find or generate an IIOP stub for the remote object. Make sure that CORBA objects have corresponding _Stub classes in the server classpath. RMI-IIOP object stubs should be generated automatically.
action002008=For CORBA objects, ensure that idlj was run on the server class. For RMI-IIOP objects, contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002011=The server was unable to marshal an exception for transmission to the caller. A generic SystemException will be sent instead.
cause002011=The server could not find appropriate exception definitions in its classpath. For CORBA exceptions, the application must contain the Exception Helper classes as well as the exception classes.
action002011=Add missing exception classes to the application.
messagedetail002012=The server was unable to send the appropriate exception back to the caller but sent a generic SystemException instead.
cause002012=This only happens if the connection between the client and server was very unreliable.
action002012=Verify the client-server network connection is working. Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002013=The server was unable to send the appropriate exception back to the caller and also failed to send a generic SystemException.
cause002013=Some sort of communication failure has occurred. This could be because the target closed the IIOP connection or because of some transient network fault.
action002013=Verify the client-server network connection.
messagedetail002014=The IIOP subsystem is operational and is listening for incoming IIOP requests.
cause002014=The IIOP subsystem is operational and is listening for incoming IIOP requests.
action002014=No action required.
messagedetail002015=The server was unable to install the WebLogic Server version of javax.rmi.CORBA.UtilDelegate.
cause002015=Some application code, or a foreign ORB, set the system property javax.rmi.CORBA.UtilClass or tried accessing javax.rmi.CORBA.Util functions before the IIOP subsystem had initialized.
action002015=The IIOP subsystem will not function correctly in this scenario. Correct the application code and restart the server.
messagedetail002016=The server was unable to install the WebLogic Server version of javax.rmi.CORBA.PortableRemoteObjectDelegate.
cause002016=Some application code, or a foreign ORB, set the system property javax.rmi.CORBA.PortableRemoteObjectClass or tried accessing javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject functions before the IIOP subsystem had initialized.
action002016=The IIOP subsystem will not function correctly in this scenario. Correct the application code and restart the server.
messagedetail002017=This indicates whether the server will send IIOP LocateRequest messages in order to obtain object references for remote objects. Some foreign application servers do not handle LocateRequest messages properly and others require LocateRequest messages.
cause002017=This is an informational message.
action002017=No action required.
messagedetail002018=The default version of the GIOP protocol that will be used by the IIOP subsystem, in general, should be set to 1.2. However, some C++ ORBs decode GIOP 1.2 incorrectly and in this case other GIOP versions can be tried.
cause002018=This is an informational message.
action002018=No action required.
messagedetail002019=The LocationForward policy indicates whether requests for the name service will redirect the caller to a different name service object reference within the cluster.
cause002019=This is an informational message.
action002019=No action required.
messagedetail002021=This indicates the location in JNDI where the server has bound the IIOP security service. This is a proprietary IIOP extension that can be used by foreign ORB clients that do not support CSIv2 to perform client authentication.
cause002021=This is an informational message.
action002021=No action required.
messagedetail002022=The IIOP subsystem was unable to bind the proprietary IIOP security service into JNDI.
cause002022=This is an internal JNDI problem.
action002022=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002023=The SendingContext RunTime provided by the remote server was not resolvable. This will prevent the interoperation of evolved classes.
cause002023=The client provided an invalid object reference for SendingContext RunTime.
action002023=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002026=The IIOP subsystem will use the CORBA OTS for transaction propagation by default. If you enable JTA, or another transaction mechanism, then WebLogic Server will be forced to use that mechanism for transaction propagation. JTA for IIOP is non-standard and not interoperable with non-WLS application servers.
cause002026=This is an informational message.
action002026=No action required.
messagedetail002027=The server was unable to marshal an exception for transmission to the caller and was also unable to marshal a generic SystemException.
cause002027=This error should not occur.
action002027=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002028=An Object Transaction Service (OTS) error occurred.
cause002028=OTS errors are generally not bugs but always result in exception information being lost when propagated to the caller. Thus, the root cause is always logged,so that system administrators can determine the real cause. OTS errors are generally caused by some transaction subsystem operation (for instance, a transaction being rolled back).
action002028=Make sure this is an expected error.
messagedetail002029=Debug message concerning the operation of OTS.
cause002029=Internal debug.
action002029=None.
messagedetail002030=Debug message concerning the sending and receiving of IIOP messages.
cause002030=Internal debug.
action002030=None.
messagedetail002031=Debug message concerning the format of sent and received IIOP messages.
cause002031=Internal debug.
action002031=None.
messagedetail002032=Debug message concerning the format of sent and received IIOP messages.
cause002032=Internal debug.
action002032=None.
messagedetail002033=Indicates the default native codesets that will be used by the server for string and wide string data. Some foreign ORBs incorrectly decode the native default codesets used by WebLogic Server.
cause002033=This is an informational message.
action002033=No action required.
messagedetail002034=Debug message concerning the operation of the server CosNaming implementation.
cause002034=Internal debug.
action002034=None.
messagedetail002035=Debug message concerning the security of sent and received IIOP messages.
cause002035=Internal debug.
action002035=None.
messagedetail002036=Debug message concerning the replacement of IORs with Stubs and vice versa.
cause002036=Internal debug.
action002036=None.
messagedetail002037=This indicates the location in JNDI where the server has bound the IIOP CosNaming service. It is necessary to bind CosNaming in a clustered environment so that references hold information about all members of the cluster.
cause002037=This is an informational message.
action002037=No action required.
messagedetail002038=The IIOP subsystem was unable to bind the IIOP CosNaming service into JNDI.
cause002038=This is an internal JNDI problem.
action002038=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002039=Warning message concerning the replacement of IORs with Stubs and vice versa.
cause002039=The replacer did not have enough information to do proper replacement.
action002039=Contact Oracle Customer Support.
messagedetail002041=The Connection attempt was rejected because IIOP is not enabled on this channel or Listen Address.
cause002041=The Connection attempt was rejected because IIOP is not enabled at all for this server, as determined by the ServerMBean, or is not enabled on this particular channel.
action002041=Enabled IIOP.
messagedetail002042=Debug message concerning the socket connections used for IIOP messages.
cause002042=Internal debug.
action002042=None.
messagedetail002043=Debug message concerning the operation of the server CosNaming implementation.
cause002043=An standard exception was thrown by the naming implementation.
action002043=None.
