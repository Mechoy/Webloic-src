cause200008=This is likely due to configuration errors.
action200008=Update the configuration and restart the server.
messagedetail200009=Each messaging bridge should have a source and a target destination configured. This message indicates that there is no target destination configured for a bridge.

action200009=Update the configuration and restart the server.
messagedetail200011=The bridge needs to find the adapter used by its source and target destinations, before it can start transferring messages. The adapters are deployed separately. This message indicates that one of the adapters is not found. The bridge will try again once it detects the existence of the adapter.
cause200011=One of the adapters is not deployed.
action200011=Deploy the required adapters.
messagedetail200012=The bridge needs to find the adapter(s) used by its source and target destinations, before it can start transferring messages. The adapters are deployed separately. This message indicates that the bridge successfully found the adapters.

action200020=No action required.
messagedetail200021=The bridge performed a JNDI lookup for the two adapters, and the lookup failed.
cause200021=At least one adapter was not deployed when the bridge started. It is also possible that the JNDI name configured in the bridge destinations do not match the ones in the adapter deployment descriptor file.
action200021=Check to see if the adapter(s) required by the source and target destinations are deployed on the server where the bridge is configured. Make sure that the JNDI name in the adapter deployment descriptor file matches the one in the configuration of the bridge destinations. Otherwise, no action is required. The bridge will automatically try again later.

cause200024=The administrator has shut down or stopped the bridge, or the bridge is suspended for migration.
action200024=No action required.
messagedetail200025=This message indicates that the required quality of service is unreachable. This is likely because the configurations of the underlying systems or their bridge destinations do not meet the requirement of the quality of service. It is also possible that the adapters or the underlying systems do not have sufficient supports. The bridge failed to start, because it is configured to disallow degradation of the quality of service.
cause200025=The configuration does not match the ability of the adapters and underlying systems.
action200025=Change the configuration of the bridge with a reachable quality of service, or turn on the QOSDegrationAllowed boolean.
messagedetail200026=This message indicates that errors occurred during the process of transferring messages. The bridge stopped its connections to both adapters and will attempt reconnect soon.
cause200026=There was a problem in receiving or sending messages to one of the sides of the bridge.
action200026=No action required.
messagedetail200027=This message indicates that the bridge has been idle for quite some time. It is time to check the sanity of the connections to the adapters and reestablish them.
cause200027=This may occur because the source destination is empty or because the connection to the source is stale and needs to be reestablished.
action200027=Check the source system.
messagedetail200028=This message indicates that the bridge has just started transferring messages. This may indicate that the bridge has just started transferring messages. This may also indicate that the bridge work has somehow stopped and has just restarted.
cause200028=This message indicates that the bridge has just started transferring messages.
action200028=No action required.
messagedetail200030=This message reveals the quality of service the bridge is providing. The actual quality of service may not be the same as what is configured. This only occurs when the configured quality of service is unreachable and the bridge is configured to allow the degradation of quality of service.
cause200030=This message reveals what quality of service the bridge is actually providing.
action200030=No action required.
messagedetail200031=This message indicates that the quality of service of this bridge is allowed to be downgraded if the required one is unreachable.
