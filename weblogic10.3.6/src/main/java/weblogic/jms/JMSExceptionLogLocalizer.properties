messagebody045063=The jms-interop-module must have name interop-jms and descriptor file name jms/interop-jms.xml. It has name "{0}".
stack045063=false
messagebody045064=The target named "{1}" of a JMS module inside a deployment named "{0}" must be a WLS server or a cluster. Instead, it is of type "{2}". If this was deployed from inside a J2EE application (an EAR file) the syntax for this (when using a deployment tool such as weblogic.Deployer or weblogic.WLST) is "sub-deployment-name + @ + ear-module-name + @ + target ". In this case sub-deployment-name is the name of the sub-deployment from the JMS module. The ear-module-name is the name of the JMS module found in the weblogic-application.xml file in the META-INF directory of the application. The target is the place where elements that have the given sub-deployment-name should be targeted. For example, if your JMS module has queue with a sub-deployment-name of "GroupA", and the name of the JMS module in the weblogic-application.xml file is "FirstJMSModule" and you wish that queue to be targeted to a JMS Server named "JServer" then the proper syntax when deploying this module through weblogic.Deployer or weblogic.WLST would be "GroupA@FirstJMSModule@JServer".
