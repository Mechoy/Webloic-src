action045045=Contact Oracle support.
messagedetail045047=The SubDeploymentMBean {0} in deployment {1} can only be targeted to one JMSServerMBean because an entity that can only be targeted to a single JMS server (for example a queue, topic or quota) has a sub-deployment-name element with value {0}
cause045047=The SubDeploymentMBean of the given name cannot be targeted to anything but a single JMSServer because an element of the JMS module that points to that sub-deployment can only be targeted to a single JMSServer.

However, a JMSSystemResourceMBean of name {1} could not be found. The JMS Server {0} will not boot until this problem has been fixed.
cause045048=The temporary template for a JMS server must come from a JMSSystemResourceMBean. A common mistake is to put the temporary template into an AppDeployment. However, because the temporary template must be owned by the administrator, all temporary templates must come from JMSSystemResourceMBeans, not AppDeployments.

messagedetail045051=Two destinations with name {1} were deployed to JMSServer {0}.
cause045051=Two destinations with the same fully qualified name cannot be deployed to the same JMS Server. This error should have been caught during the validation phase of the JMS module.

cause045052=An attempt was made to change the target of an entity that cannot have its target changed dynamically.
action045052=One thing that can be done is to untarget a sub-deployment and then retarget that sub-deployment elsewhere. It should be made clear that by doing that the persistent state maintained for entities retargeted in this fashion will *not* be kept on the old target, and may or may not be removed by the system.

messagedetail045064=All the targets of a JMS module must be either of type ServerMBean or ClusterMBean. The target of this module is not one of those types. If this was deployed from inside a J2EE application (an EAR file) the syntax for this (when using a deployment tool such as weblogic.Deployer or weblogic.WLST) is sub-deployment-name + "@" + ear-module-name + "@;" + target. In this case sub-deployment-name is the name of the sub-deployment from the JMS module itself, the ear-module-name is the name of the JMS module found in the weblogic-application.xml file in the META-INF directory of the application and the target is the place where elements that have the given sub-deployment-name should be targeted. For example, if your JMS module has queue with a sub-deployment-name of "GroupA", and the name of the JMS module in the weblogic-application.xml file is "FirstJMSModule" and you wish that queue to be targeted to a JMS Server named "JServer" then the proper syntax when deploying this module through weblogic.Deployer or weblogic.WLST would be "GroupA@FirstJMSModule@JServer".
