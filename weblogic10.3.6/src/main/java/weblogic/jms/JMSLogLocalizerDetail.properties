Consider moving this destination to another module and using the new quota feature.
cause040475=Quotas have been reworked. They are no longer hierarchical in nature. Instead, they are objects that can be pointed to explicitly and can be optionally shared between destinations. Hence quotas no longer work as they did in previous releases. When converting from older releases a decision is made about how to handle quotas based on the setting of the old parameters. These decisions may have been wrong, which would cause this warning to happen.

messagedetail040503=The delivery mode override value of destination "{0}" hosted on JMS Server "{1}" has been changed from {2} to {3}. This has been done because the older configuration never supported persistent messages and hence all messages were downgraded to non-persistent. During the upgrade process a configuration was detected that would force all messages through the given destination to be non-persistent, so the upgrade process made that override explicit.
cause040503=During the upgrade process a configuration was detected that would force all messages through the given destination to be non-persistent, so the upgrade process made that override explicit.
action040503=Review your application code and configuration. If you need some behavior other than the one the upgrade process chose, you can modify the resulting configuration using the DeliveryMode parameter of the OverridesParams of the destination, or with the HasStore or AllowsPersistentDowngrade parameters of the JMSServer on which the destination is targeted.
messagedetail040504=While attempting to add an entity with name "{0}" an error occurred while trying to convert the old style entity to the new style entity. The error was "{1}".

messagedetail040505=The JMS module named "{0}" inside application "{1}" does not have a sub-deployment stanza named "{0}". Without such a stanza no entities inside the module will be deployed, since the sub deployments inside of the sub-deployment stanza named "{0}" control where JMS entities inside this module are targeted.
cause040505=When a JMS module is inside an EAR file, the targeting information for entities inside that module are nested within a sub-deployment named after the name of the JMS module found in the weblogic-application.xml file of the EAR file. If no sub-deployment exists with the name of the JMS module, then no targeted entities inside the module will become available. This is usually an oversight on the part of the administrator.
action040505=Add a sub-deployment stanza with the name of the JMS module as specified in the weblogic-application.xml file to the app-deployment stanza. Nested inside that sub-deployment you can target the entities in the module normally.
