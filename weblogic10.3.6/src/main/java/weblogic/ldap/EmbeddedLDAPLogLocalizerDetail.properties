messagedetail171500=The lib directory contains the configuration files required for the embedded LDAP server. If those files are missing or the appropriate directory cannot be found, then the embedded LDAP server cannot initialize.
cause171500=The embedded LDAP server cannot find the specified file. This file is installed as part of the installation process. Most likely, the default directory is not the server root directory and the lib subdirectory cannot be found.
action171500=Set the default directory to the server root directory or set the location of the embedded LDAP server configuration files via the weblogic.EmbeddedLDAPConfigDirectory system property.
messagedetail171503=The Listen address for the Admin server is required so that the replicated LDAP servers can receive changes from the master LDAP server that runs on the Admin server. If the Listen address for the Admin server is null, replication may not occur.
cause171503=The Listen address is null.
action171503=Check to see if the Listen address for the Admin server is defined in either the Server MBean, the ServerRuntime MBean, or the URL specified by the weblogic.management.server command-line property.
messagedetail171507=The embedded LDAP server stores replica information in the file {0}. This file could not be written because of an exception.
cause171507=An exception occurred when saving the replica properties to the replicas file.
action171507=Verify that the file {1} can be written to. Read the exception text for more information in diagnosing the problem.
messagedetail171512=The embedded LDAP server initializes a new replica in a Managed server by downloading a new replica from the Admin server and then importing it into the local replicated LDAP server. If this process fails, the embedded LDAP server attempts to cleanup and delete the local files. However, file {0} could not be deleted. The {1} directory and all its files MUST be deleted manually.
cause171512=It is not always possible to delete files that are open by a process.
action171512=Delete the {1} directory and all its files manually using the appropriate command for the operating system on which WebLogic server runs.
messagedetail171513=The Embedded LDAP server uses a trigger to perform periodic cleanup operations. The trigger could not be scheduled due to an exception.
cause171513=A TimeTrigger exception was thrown when scheduling the trigger.
action171513=Read the exception text in {0} for more information in diagnosing the problem.
messagedetail171517=WebLogic Server attempts to exclusively lock a file in the embedded LDAP server data file directory. When attempting to lock this file, an exception occurred.
cause171517=An exclusive lock for the directory {0} could not be obtained because an exception occurred.
action171517=Investigate the associated exception and attempt to determine why the exclusive lock failed.
messagedetail171518=A stack trace is being printed for an exception that occurred.
cause171518=An error condition has occurred.
action171518=Read the associated exception in the log. In general, a stack trace will help when debugging an existing problem.
messagedetail171519=An embedded LDAP server is already using this directory. Since in memory data structures are used, two embedded LDAP servers cannot run at the same time in the same directory.
cause171519=An exclusive lock for the directory {0} could not be obtained because another WebLogic Server is already using this directory.
action171519=Ensure that the first WebLogic Server is shutdown and try rebooting the server.
messagedetail171520=An embedded LDAP server is already using this directory. Since in memory data structures are used, two embedded LDAP servers cannot run at the same time in the same directory. WebLogic Server will wait for {1} seconds and retry to get the exclusive lock just in case the other WebLogic Server is still shutting down.
cause171520=An exclusive lock for the directory {0} could not be obtained because another WebLogic Server is already using this directory.
action171520=If the server eventually boots, then ignore this warning as the lock was obtained. If the server fails to boot, ensure that the first WebLogic Server is shutdown and try rebooting the server.
messagedetail171521=An exception was thrown when initializing the Embedded LDAP server. The initialization failed and the server cannot boot.
cause171521=There may be a problem with either the Embedded LDAP server configuration files or the data files.
action171521=Investigate the associated exception and attempt to determine why the exception occurred. Retry the reboot of the server and see if the refresh of the replica data files solves the problem.
messagedetail171522=An exception was thrown when initializing the Embedded LDAP server. The initialization failed and the server cannot boot.
cause171522=There may be a problem with either the Embedded LDAP server configuration files or the data files.
action171522=Investigate the associated exception and attempt to determine why the exception occurred. Retry the reboot of the server.
messagedetail171523=The Credential attribute of the Embedded LDAP MBean is null or a zero-length byte array.
cause171523=The Credential attribute is invalid.
action171523=Set the Credential attribute for the Embedded LDAP server configuration.
messagedetail171524=The Listen address for the Admin server is required so that the replicated LDAP servers can receive changes from the master LDAP server that runs on the Admin server. If the Listen address for the Admin server is not determined, replication may not occur.
cause171524=The Admin server URI has invalid syntax.
action171524=Make sure a valid Listen address for the Admin server is defined in either the Server MBean, the ServerRuntime MBean, or the URL specified by the weblogic.management.server command-line property.
messagedetail171525=Error loading initial replica file. Check EmbeddedLDAP log for more details.
cause171525=An error occurred during the loading of the initial replica file.
action171525=Check EmbeddedLDAP log for more details.
messagedetail171526=An error occurred during the loading of the initial replica file. The initial replica file will be loaded again.
cause171526=An error occurred during the loading of the initial replica file.
action171526=None. The initial replica file will be loaded again.
messagedetail171527=The reload of the initial replica file was a success.
cause171527=An error occurred during the initial loading of the replica file.
action171527=None. The reload of the initial replica file was successful.
