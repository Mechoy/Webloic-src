messagedetail149412=Application "{0}" is being redeployed, because it changed since the previous server run.
cause149412=This application is deployed using auto-deployment. The application was modified while the server was down. Hence it will be redeployed by the auto-deployment poller. Another possible reason is that the internal file used by the poller was removed or moved from disk. In that case, it assumes applications have changed.
action149412=No action is required. This is an informational message to explain why this deployment was redeployed after its deployment at startup.

action149417=Ensure no other process is attempting to lock part or all of this application file. If the copy is ongoing, then no action should be necessary.
