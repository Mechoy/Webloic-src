Internal Script that sets the offline commands to NO-OP
once a user connects to a running server. These are mostly
Offline WLST commands

WARNING: This file is part of the WLST implementation and as such may
change between versions of WLST. You should not try to reuse the logic
in this script or keep copies of this script. Doing so could cause
your WLST scripts to fail when you upgrade to a different version of
WLST.
