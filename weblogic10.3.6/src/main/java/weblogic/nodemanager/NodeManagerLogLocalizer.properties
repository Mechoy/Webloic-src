messagebody300049=An I/O error occurred while writing the server URL file: "{0}".
messagebody300051=An I/O error occurred while updating the startup properties for "{0}". This probably occured because the node manager is unreachable. This could mean that the servers boot.properties or startup.properties file is out of date, and the next time node manager attempts to automatically restart the server on a failure, it will use out of date properties. To resolve this issue, either ensure the node manager is able to receive the updates and reset the properties or restart the server.
messagebody300052=The script path specified, ''{0}'', contains improper characters. The script path must be a valid path that exists within the nodemanager script execution directory.
messagebody300053=A migratable server was not found to contain any specified IP address in the ServerMBean or custom network channels for migration. No IPs will be passed to NodeManager and No IPs will be migrated. The server may not start without an available address, or may not be accessible throughout migration without a consistent IP. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
messagebody300054=Could not find appropriate IP for ListenAddress "{0}" specified for a migratable server. Reason: "{1}". The NodeManager may not be able to bind the address specified and the server may not start without the available address. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
