messagedetail300048=An I/O error occurred while attempting to start the specified server.
cause300048=The most likely cause is a configuration error in the Shell/SSH/RSH NodeManager configuration.
action300048=Make sure that you can access the remote NodeManager. This may require setting up SSH permissions for the SSH-based NodeManager. Also ensure that the default PATH settings for the remote NodeManager are correct. See the NodeManager documentation for more information.
messagedetail300049=An I/O exception occurred while writing the current server default URL to the server URL file. As a result the current server default URL will not be saved. The node manager uses the contents of this file on restart in conjunction with the pid file. After checking the existence of the process using the PID stored in the pid file, the node manager will try to communicate to the server using the default URL to make sure that the process is indeed the WLS server. Without this file, nodemanager will not be able to perform the second check.
cause300049=Server URL file might be write protected.
action300049=Make sure that the server URL file is not write protected. Also check to see if the parent directory exists (should have been created by the node manager server before starting the server)
messagedetail300051=An I/O error occurred while updating the startup properties for "{0}". This probably occured because the node manager is unreachable. This could mean that the servers boot.properties or startup.properties file is out of date, and the next time node manager attempts to automatically restart the server on a failure, it will use out of date properties. To resolve this issue, either ensure the node manager is able to receive the updates and reset the properties or restart the server.
