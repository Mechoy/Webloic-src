When servlets or other classes from the WAR are reloaded, this classloader is replaced with a new one. When a classloader-structure definition is given in weblogic-application.xml, it is possible that a Web application will share its classloader with other modules. In this case, automatic class reloading is disabled for the Web application.

messagedetail101367=Error occurred while extracting archived file for "{0}", located at "{1}".
cause101367=An error occurred while extracting the archived war file, due to path length limitations on some OS's
action101367=Some OS's only allow a certain number of characters in the file name. This limitation can be noticed when extracting an archive in a deeply nested directory. Since the default temporary directory for extracting all archives is relative to the server root directory, it is recommended that one use the System property weblogic.j2ee.application.tmpDir and set it to a shorter file path. OR one could ensure that the server is started in a directory with a shorted file path.
