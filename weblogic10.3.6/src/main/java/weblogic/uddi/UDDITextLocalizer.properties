230000=<p>You can use this page to locate WSDLs to use with the Web service that you are building. Your WebLogic Server has its own UDDI registry -- an indexed and organized collection of WSDLs built and maintained by your company -- that you can implement in your Web service. Public UDDI registries such as UDDI.org and VisualNet SIC can also be a resource when you are looking for a WSDL.</p> <p>To find a WSDL stored in a private WebLogic Server UDDI, select "Search private registry". If you have problems accessing the registry, check with your WebLogic Server administrator.</p> <p>To find a WSDL stored in a public WebLogic Server UDDI, select "Search Public Registries".</p>
