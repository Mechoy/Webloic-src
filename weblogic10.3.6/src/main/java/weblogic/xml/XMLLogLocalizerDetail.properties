messagedetail130000=XML Entities to be cached cannot be larger than the size of the cache itself. The cache has rejected the entity.
cause130000=The cache may be too small or a specific item might be legitimately very large. The worst case is that this indicates a denial of service attack.
action130000=No action required. However, performance will be best if items are cached.
messagedetail130001=Attempts to insert or retrieve items from the XML entity cache are failing for unknown reasons. This does not prevent XML parsing, but parse performance will be impacted. Also, the cache provides a fallback in the case of a network failure. If the cache is not operational, this fullback is not in effect.
cause130001=Unknown
action130001=No action is required. However, performance will increase if items are cached. Also the cache provides a fallback in the case of a network failure. While the cache is not operating, this fullback is not in effect.
messagedetail130002=A check is made just after an entity is added to the cache to ensure that that entity can be retrieved. The test failed for the current entity.
cause130002=Usually this indicates that the entity timeout was set to a very small value. Otherwise there is some unknown problem with the cache module itself.
action130002=No action is required, but XML parse performance will be impacted. Also there is no cached copy to act as a backup in the event of a network failure.
messagedetail130003=The factory class specified in the console could not be instantiated. The factory can be of type: SAXParserFactory, DocumentBuilderFactory, or TransformerFactory. Proceeding with default WebLogic factory.
cause130003=Class name of the factory is not correct or it is not in the CLASSPATH.
action130003=Check your CLASSPATH or verify your console entry.
messagedetail130006=Entry exceeds cache memory size.
cause130006=The entry is larger than the cache.
action130006=No action required unless you want the item to be cached next time. If so, increase the cache memory size.

action130009=No action is required. If you want the entry to be persisted next time, increase the disk size of the cache.

messagedetail130019=The system has detected that an entry in the cache file has been corrupted.

messagedetail130024=Insufficient memory to load entry from disk cache.
cause130024=The entry might be unusually large or perhaps the JVM heap size is too small.
action130024=Check the size of the rejected entry. If you wish to be able to handle entries of that size, increase the heap size.
messagedetail130025=Out of memory exception encountered when loading data from cache.
cause130025=The cache file is not large, so you are close to the wall on memory usage.

cause130027=Either the provided parameters are not in sync with usage, or something is using a lot of the available memory.
action130027=Reduce the cache size or increase the JVM heap size. If you think there should be more available memory, determine what is using all the memory.
messagedetail130028=This may signal a low memory condition.
cause130028=Either the provided parameters are not in sync with usage, or something is using a lot of the available memory.
